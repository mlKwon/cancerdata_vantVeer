"Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer" by van't Veer

https://www.nature.com/articles/415530a

This is the example code for predicted classifier cancer metastases in 5 years or not among breast cancer patients.

# data description

VEER   : 78 X 25,000 (approximately)

VEER1  : 78 X 5,000  (approximately)

YOUNG1 : 19 X 5,000  (approximately)

We will follow the sequence in this thesis, but modify incorrect part a little (ex. predicted table).
